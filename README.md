A C++ utility designed to work with RootsMagic genealogy database files, specifically focusing on extracting and processing data for integration with other applications. 
This utility currently exports names from RootsMagic and generates a SQL script to add them as tags in DigiKam, maintaining references back to the original RootsMagic OwnerID 
of each person as a property of that tag. 
This integration enables projects such as Timeline-Traveler to enrich family history with thumbnails and full photos, creating a bridge between RootsMagic genealogical data 
and DigiKam's digital photo collections.
